# Wutang Clan Name Generator 
A survey that awards you with your own Wutang Clan name.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js

A majority of the application is built with javascrit. Each button in the form is equipped with an add event listener which allows for an action to take place when it is clicked. In order to produce a specific result after a user selects a certain button combination, each button was declared as a variable and given an initial value of zero. When a user clicked on the button, it would be given a value specified in the html. Adding all of these values together would produce a specific Wutang Name. 

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a strategy for providing specific responses to a user's f orm submission via this project. I will deinitely be using this logic in future projects.
